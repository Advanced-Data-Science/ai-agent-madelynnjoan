CDC NORS DATA SET AI AGENT
CS3870 


Project Overview

  This project collects data from the CDC National Outbreak Reporting System 
(NORS) API. The goal is to retrieve outbreak data (e.g., year, state, 
illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths) for analysis of public health trends 
across years and states.

The project includes:
  A config file to store API endpoint and parameters.
  A Python agent that handles requests, error-checking, and logging.
  A report that tracks collection success, failures, and key metrics.
  
  
How to Run

  Download the config file and AI agent script.
  Make sure the config file has the parameters (year, state) you want.
  Run the agent.
  The records and summary report will be written automatically.
